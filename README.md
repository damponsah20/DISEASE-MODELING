# DISEASE-MODELING
This script provides insights into modeling of some diseases and how the population of the various classes(susceptible class, exposed class, infected class and recovered class) changes relative to time
Please note that the parameters used are just for demostration purposes and as such the model does not acurrately predit the spread of the disease.
